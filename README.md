# Equilibrium_Option_Pricing_in_Stochastic_Differential_Games_Code

This repository contains the code accompanying the paper  
**“Equilibrium Option Pricing in Stochastic Differential Games.”**

The purpose of this repository is to provide implementations of the models,
PDEs, and numerical methods used in the paper, and to ensure reproducibility
of the theoretical and numerical results.

## Contents
- Source code for solving the associated HJB / Isaacs equations
- Numerical experiments and simulations used in the paper
- Scripts for generating figures (where applicable)

## Usage
The code is organized by functionality and can be run independently for
numerical experiments. Detailed instructions and dependencies will be added
as the repository is finalized.

## Notes
This repository is intended for academic and research use.  
If you use or build upon this code, please cite the corresponding paper.
